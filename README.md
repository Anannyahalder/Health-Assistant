# Health-Assistant
# Health Condition Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine) to predict a health condition based on clinical parameters.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `health_related.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `README.md`: Project overview, requirements, and usage instructions.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on clinical data such as:
